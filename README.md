# Notepad SPA

**This is a notepad SPA (single page application) with a react and redux front-end and a rest API that uses a postgres to store notes.**

Technology used:
- Written in es6 (use babel)
- Use webpack for packaging client side code
- expressjs
- nodejs
- npm
- React
- Redux
- CSS animations
- Postgress

This nice and clean Notepad is available 24/7 in here: [Notepad](http://aws.jiajunzhou.ca:3000/).

## If you want this to running locally:

First, Install postgres and creat a server with following credentials

**username:postgres password:password**

After you login to your server, set up a postgres database called 'todo' on your local machine.

Now, you are really to clone my code!

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/JiajunZhou1995/Notepad.git
# Go into the repository
cd Notepad
# Install dependencies
npm install
# compile all the js code
webpack
# Run the app
npm start
```

Finally, go to localhost:3000 in your browser and have fun.

## WARNING
**This is my first try on expressjs, React and Redux, so the overall desgin may not be the best, be careful if you want to imitate my code.**
